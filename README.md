# Debugging under QEMU

[Standard QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/arm/stm32.html)
distribution does not support STM32F412xx. Use
[xPack](https://xpack.github.io/dev-tools/qemu-arm/install/)
disto instead. [This fella](https://aperles.blogs.upv.es/2020/04/15/simulation-emulation-of-the-stm32f4-discovery-board/)
provides somewhat satisfactory manual that might give one some hints.
